# 💻 VS Code configs ⚙️
My settings file stay here, and I use [Custom CSS and JS Loader](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css) extension to complement styles configs.

## Warning

My VS code is minimalist, so... I don´t organize with tabs on top, it is more aimed at improving my performance and focus on the code with **ctrl + p** to assistant my navigation.
